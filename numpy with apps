#The admission fee at a small fair is $1.50 for children and $4.00 for adults. On a certain day,
# 2200 people enter the fair and $5050 is collected. How many children and how many adults attended?

Let A is number of children, and B is number of Adults

A+B=2200
1.5A+4B=5050


#Programing in python numpy

import numpy as np

A = np.array([1,1],[1.5,4])
B= np.array([2200,5050])

np.ligalg.solve(A,B)

>>>Output  :  array([1500..,700..])

A = 1500
b = 5050
